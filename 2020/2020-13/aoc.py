# I thought Z3 would just be able to satisfy the straightforward set of
# constraints, but it just sits and spins forever.
#
# The set of constraints is of the form:
#
#     t % n == n - i
#
# Where t is the timestamp we're looking for, n is the bus number, and i is the
# bus's position in the list. If we have a gander at our input, the bus numbers
# are:
#
#     17,41,983,29,19,23,397,37,13
#
# Looks suspicious, how about the example inputs:
#
#    17,13,19
#    67,7,59,61
#    1789,37,47,1889
#
# All prime numbers. So there's clearly some crazy number theory thing going on
# here, and some googling reveals that what we're looking for is probably:
#
#     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem
#
# The explanation there for how to apply it is very hard to follow. Here is
# textbook with a concrete example in Sage:
#
#     https://www.math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/section-using-crt.html
#
# In their example x % 5 == 1, x % 6 == 2, x % 7 == 3. To find x:
#
#     n = [5, 6, 7]               # the moduli
#     a = [1, 2, 3]               # the remainders
#     N = prod(n)                 # the target modulus
#     c = [N//ni for ni in n]     # the complement moduli
#     d = [multiplicative_inverse_mod(ci, ni) for ci, ni in zip(c, n)]
#     x = sum(prod(acd) for acd in zip(a, c, d)) % N
