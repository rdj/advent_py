    # terminate.

    # out the number of steps.
    #
    # It generally takes (N-1) steps to produce N tokens, and then we adjust
    # for the special nonterminals. The paren-like symbols (Rn, Ar) come along
    # for free. The comma-like symbol (Y) is free and also brings along an
    # extra free nonterminal.

# It seems so ill-advised, but I am going to just BFS this since this is 2015
# and so far every time I've tried to be cleverer than that it has been a waste
# of my time. I'm gonna guess from the way things are hinted the only real
# optimization you need is to prune duplicate paths.
#
# Ok, lol, brute force did not work this time. It ran for a while and didn't
# come up with an answer so now it's time to look at the input.
#
# If I'm remembering my college courses correctly, this looks like a
# context-free grammar, and probably we care which productions are terminal vs
# non-terminal, and there's definitely a normalized form that they might be in
# that would make things easier. Later: It's not in Chomsky normal form.
