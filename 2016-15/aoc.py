# We have a set of discs with a distance (i+1), modulus (m) and start
# position (s).
#
# Notably, the moduli are all prime numbers.
#
# We want to choose a launch time (t0) so that the disc is at position 0
# when the ball arrives.
#
# The ball will arrive at t = t0 + (i+1).
#
# The disc position is given by (s + t) % m.
#
# So at the time of arrival: (s + t0 + i + 1) % m == 0.
#
# Rewriting, t0 % m == -(s + i + 1) % m
#
# There aren't very many discs, and who knows what part 2 is, but this is a
# straightforward application of the Chinese Remainder Theorum, which I
# already learned for a previous (future) Advent of Code (2020-13).
#
# Later: it turns out this was small enough brute force simluation would have
# been fine. Even back in 2016 when this problem written, redditors made the
# leaderboards with brute force. Several people chimed in about using Chinese
# Remainder Theorum via Mathematica (or pen and paper), and I sort of wonder of
# those comments gave the author the idea for the 2020 problem which was too
# big to brute force.
