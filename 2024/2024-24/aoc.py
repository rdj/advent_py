    # With the code above, I determined four bits that have problems. Since I
    # found that each z only depends on same/earlier x/y, I'm hoping this means
    # that each of the four bits has a localized problem with its adder that
    # can be fixed by swapping two outputs.
    #
    # I did not come up with a reasonable programmatic way to review the adder
    # design. (LATER NOTE: It seems like most people used graphviz or similar
    # to visually examine the circuit layout for problems.) I did an image
    # search for a full adder and then came up with an example for what that
    # would look like in the format of this puzzle:
    #
    # Example full adder for bit 2:
    #
    #   x02 XOR y02        -> xor02
    # xor02 XOR carry01    -> z02
    #   x02 AND y02        -> and02
    # xor02 AND carry01    -> precarry02
    # and02  OR precarry02 -> carry02
    #
    # Bits 0 and 45 will differ because of no carry in and out respectively.
    # The intermediate values I've called xor02, and02, carry01, precarry02,
    # and carry02 all have random 3-char names in the puzzle input.
    #
    # So now I manually isolate the five adder rules for each of the broken
    # bits and look for a swap that fixes them.

    swaps = []

    # BIT 5.
    #
    # The z05 rule is AND rule instead of XOR rule, so we have to figure out
    # whether it is and05 or precarry05. And swap accordingly. Here are the
    # rules:
    #
    #     x05 XOR y05 -> hdc (xor05)
    #     y05 AND x05 -> z05 <--
    #     gcs XOR hdc -> dkr <--

    #     dkr OR  fdd -> bvc (carry05)
    #
    # Fixed by swapping z05 and dkr.
    swaps += ['z05', 'dkr']

    # BIT 15.
    #
    # Again the z15 rule is AND instead of XOR. Same logic as bit 5.
    #
    #     y15 XOR x15 -> bhw (xor15)
    #     sth AND bhw -> z15 <--
    #     y15 AND x15 -> hhb (and15)
    #     bhw XOR sth -> htp <--
    #     hhb OR  htp -> mqr (carry15)
    #
    # Fixed by swapping z15 and htp.
    swaps += ['z15', 'htp']

    # BIT 20.
    #
    # The z20 rule is an OR rule, so it must be swapped with the carry20 rule.
    #
    #     x20 XOR y20 -> mvv (xor20)
    #     qfj OR  mqg -> z20 <--
    #     x20 AND y20 -> mqg (and20)
    #     mvv AND fvm -> qfj (precarry20)
    #     mvv XOR fvm -> hhh <--
    #
    # Fixed by swapping z20, hhh.
    swaps += ['z20', 'hhh']

    # BIT 36.
    #
    # This one was trickier since the z rule itself looked fine. So next look
    # at the x/y rules, xor36 and and36. You can see they're wired wrong. For
    # example, carry36 needs to consume xor36 instead of and36.
    #
    #     y36 XOR x36 -> rhv <--
    #     ggk XOR hpg -> z36
    #      ^------------------------- This is and36 but should be xor36.
    #     x36 AND y36 -> ggk <--
    #     ggk AND hpg -> bqf (precarry36)
    #      ^------------------------- This is and36 but should be xor36.
    #     bqf OR  rhv -> gqf (carry36)
    #              ^----------------- This is the xor36 but should be and36.
