# I can't really explain this; I just printed out solutions and came up with a

# then count up by one halfway to the next power of three, then count up by two
# for the second half:
#
#    1:     1
#
#    2:     1
#    3:     3
#
#    4:     1 (reset after 3**1, count by +1)
#    5:     2
#    6:     3
#    7:     5 (second half, count by +2)
#    8:     7
#    9:     9
#
#    ... Up to 27 ...
#    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27
#    ... after that it resets and builds back to 81, etc. ...
#
# Later, I checked OEIS and sure enough this sequence is documented as
# "The n-cowboy shootout problem".
